Welcome!

Back in 2010, you created a bitcoin wallet. Now it's worth $350 million,
but you can't get in because you forgot the password. Luckily, you wrote
it down and hid it behind a painting🖼️  in your boss's office.

--- OBJECTIVE ---

Your mission is to find that hidden paper with the password.

--- INSTRUCTION 1 ---

Head to the folder named "Office building" 🏢 and look up for the further
instructions there (todo.txt).

Let the hunt begin! 😎
